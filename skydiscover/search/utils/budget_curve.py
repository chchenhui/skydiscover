"""Budget-Aware AUC over a fixed cost window.

A search run traces a curve on the (cost, performance) plane: after spending
``c``, the best solution found so far scores ``s(c)``.  ``s`` is a
non-decreasing step function -- the score you would report if the run were
stopped right there. Integrating it over ``[0, B]`` gives **BA-AUC(B)**: the
area between the best-so-far curve and the cost axis. Finding the same score
earlier produces a larger area.

The module has two halves:

``budget_aware_auc`` / ``normalized_budget_aware_auc``
    Pure functions over ``(cost, score)`` samples.  Use them to score runs
    that already finished -- the samples can come from a ``budget_curve.jsonl``
    written by a live run, or be reconstructed from any other log.

``BudgetCurve``
    Live recorder wired to the global :class:`~skydiscover.llm.pricing.CostTracker`.
    A controller calls :meth:`BudgetCurve.observe` once per iteration; the
    curve reads how much has been spent, tracks the incumbent, and can say
    whether the budget is exhausted.

    """Draw the incumbent curves of several runs on one cost/performance plot.

    One step line per run: ``x`` is cumulative spend, ``y`` is the best score
    found by then. The y-axis always starts at zero, so heights stay
    comparable and the first jump off the seed program reads at true scale.

    A run that stopped before the right edge keeps its last incumbent, drawn
    faded past the end marker: the score is still held, but nothing more was
    measured.

    The area under a curve *is* its BA-AUC, so a single run is shaded by
    default. Several overlapping washes stack into an unreadable block whose
    area belongs to no one run, so multi-run plots are drawn unshaded unless
    ``fill=True`` is forced.

    Args:
        runs: ``{run name: (cost, score) samples}``. Samples need not be
            sorted or already reduced to best-so-far.
        path: output image path; the format follows the extension.
        budget: draw a marker at ``B`` and clip the x-axis there. Defaults to
            the largest observed cost across runs.
        theme: ``"light"`` or ``"dark"`` -- each has its own validated steps.
        unit: ``USD`` or ``TOKENS``, for axis labels.
        floor: incumbent before anything is scored.
        fill: shade the area under each curve (the BA-AUC itself). Defaults
            to shading only when a single run is plotted.

    Returns:
        ``path``, for convenience.
